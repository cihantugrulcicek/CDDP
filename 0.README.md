This repository contains the bechmark instances used in the paper "Communication-aware Drone Delivery Problem". An ArXiV link will be available soon. Instances are named according to spatial distribution of communication and delivery network. The first letter of the name of a particular file denotes (P)erturbed or (U)niform communication network. The second letter denotes (P)oisson Point or (U)niform delivery network. The third letter denotes (L)oose or (T)ight time windows. The number before and after underline denotes the number of customer and the number of replication, respectively. For example, PUL20_1 includes node information of the second replication of an instance with 20 customers where the communication network is perturbed, delivery network is uniformly distributed, and time windows are loose.

Each file consists of information on the nodes generated over a 5x5 km area. An example file is as follows:

node,type,x,y,earliest_time,latest_time,is_loading,waiting_time,is_charging,P
D0,Depot,0.0,0.0,0.0,28800.0,1.0,600.0,1.0,
D1,Depot,5000.0,0.0,0.0,28800.0,1.0,600.0,1.0,
...

column descriptions:
node: the unique id of a node
type: the type of a node, i.e., 'Depot' or 'ChargingStation' or 'Customer' or 'BaseStation'
x: the x coordinate of node one 2d grid
y: the y coordinate of node one 2d grid
earliest_time: the opening of time window of node
latest_time: the closing of time window of node
is_loading: indicator to denote whether or not a package can be loaded at the node. 1 denotes loading, -1 denotes unloading, 0 denotes neither loading nor unloading
waiting_time: the fixed time required to perform activities at the node
is_charging: indicator to denote whether or not a drone can be charged at the node. 1 denotes charging available, 0 denotes charging unavaliable
P: transmit power for a base station node
